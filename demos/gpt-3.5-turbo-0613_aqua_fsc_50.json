To find out how many years it will take for the sum of money to become six times itself, we need to find the time it takes for the money to double twice. \n\nSince the interest rate is 20% per year, it will take 100% / 20% = 5 years for the money to double. Therefore, it will take 5 years * 2 = 10 years for the money to double twice. \n\nSo, the sum of money will become six times itself in 10 years.

Since there are 10 numbers less than 31 that are divisible by 3, the highest power of 3 that divides A is 3^10.\n\nTherefore, the highest power of 18 that divides A is 2^15 * 3^10.\n\nTo find the greatest integer k for which A/18^k is an integer, we need to find the highest power of 18 that divides A, which is 2^15 * 3^10. Since 18 = 2 * 3^2, we can rewrite 18^k as (2^1 * 3^2)^k = 2^k * 3^(2k).\n\nTo make A/18^k an integer, the highest power of 2 and 3 that divides A must be greater than or equal to the highest power of 2 and 3 that divides 18^k, which is 2^k * 3^(2k).\n\nTherefore, the greatest integer k for which A/18^k is an integer is the highest power of 2 and 3 that divides A, which is 10.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 7.", "The area of the courtyard is 18m * 16m = 288 square meters.\nThe area of each brick is 20cm * 10cm = 200 square centimeters = 0.02 square meters.\nSo, the total number of bricks required is 288 square meters / 0.02 square meters = 14400.\nThe answer is (E).", "The pattern in the series is that the first number increases by 3, the second number decreases by 2, and the third number increases by 3 again.
