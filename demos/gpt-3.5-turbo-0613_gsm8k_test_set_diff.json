She got two packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum and half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. So the cost of the two packs of strawberry gum plus the cost of the grape gum and the green apple gum is $7. Let's call the cost of each pack of strawberry gum x. The cost of the two packs of strawberry gum is 2x. The cost of the grape gum is $2. The cost of the green apple gum is half of x, which is x/2. So the equation is 2x + $2 + x/2 = $7. To solve for x, we can simplify the equation: 2x + $2 + x/2 = $7. Multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 4x + $4 + x = $14. Combine like terms: 5x + $4 = $14.
