Since there are two semi circles, the total area of the semi circles is 200\u03c0 cm^2.

There are 15 multiples of 2, 7 multiples of 4, 3 multiples of 8, 1 multiple of 16, and 1 multiple of 18.

There are 10 multiples of 3, 3 multiples of 9, and 1 multiple of 18. So the highest power of 3 that divides A is 3^10.\n\nTherefore, the highest power of 18 that divides A is 2^15 * 3^10. \n\nTo find the value of k, we need to find the exponent of 18 in the prime factorization of A. \n\nThe exponent of 18 in the prime factorization of A is min(15, 10) = 10.\n\nTherefore, the greatest integer k for which A/18^k is an integer is 10.

Therefore, p^2 < q^2 is always true. The answer is (A).", "Let the length of the field be L and the width be W. Since the area of the field is 80 sq. feet, we have LW = 80. \n\nWe are given that one side of the field is 20 feet uncovered, so the perimeter of the field is L + W + L = 2L + W = 80 + 20 = 100. \n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the values of L and W. \n\nFrom LW = 80, we can rewrite it as W = 80/L. \n\nSubstituting this into the perimeter equation, we have 2L + 80/L = 100. \n\nMultiplying through by L, we get 2L^2 + 80 = 100L. \n\nRearranging, we have 2L^2 - 100L + 80 = 0. \n\nDividing through by 2, we get L^2 - 50L + 40 = 0. \n\nFactoring, we have (L - 10)(L - 4) = 0. \n\nSo L = 10 or L = 4. \n\nIf L = 10, then W = 80/10 = 8. \n\nIf L = 4, then W = 80/4 = 20. \n\nSince we are fencing three sides, we need to find the perimeter of the field. \n\nIf L = 10, then the perimeter is 2(10) + 8 = 28. \n\nIf L = 4, then the perimeter is 2(4) + 20 = 28. \n\nSo the answer is (A) 28.", "Let the length of the train be x meters and its speed be y m/s.\n\nThe train takes 20 seconds to cross the bridge, so the total distance covered by the train and the bridge is 165 + x meters.\nThe train takes 8 seconds to cross the man, so the distance covered by the train is x meters.\n\nUsing the formula distance = speed * time, we can set up the following equations:\n\n165 + x = y * 20\nx = y * 8\n\nSimplifying the second equation, we get:\ny = x/8\n\nSubstituting this value of y into the first equation, we get:\n165 + x = (x/8) * 20\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n165 + x = 2.5x\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n1.5x = 165\n\nDividing both sides by 1.5, we get:\nx = 110\n\nSubstituting this value of x into the second equation, we get:\ny = 110/8\ny = 13.75\n\nTherefore, the length of the train is 110 meters and its speed is 13.75 m/s.

The total annual income is $100 + x * 0.08. \n\nAccording to the problem, the total annual income should be equal to 6% of her entire investment. So, 0.06 * (2000 + x) = $100 + x * 0.08. \n\nSimplifying the equation, we get 120 + 0.06x = $100 + 0.08x. \n\nSubtracting 0.06x and $100 from both sides, we get 20 = 0.02x. \n\nDividing both sides by 0.02, we get x = 1000. \n\nTherefore, Barbata must invest an additional $1000 at 8%.

Then the cost of the 28 inch TV would be x + $200, the cost of the 30 inch TV would be x + $400, and the cost of the 32 inch TV would be x + $600.\n\nSo, the total cost of the 4 TVs would be x + (x + $200) + (x + $400) + (x + $600) = 4x + $1,200.\n\nWe know that the total cost is $3,600, so we can set up the equation 4x + $1,200 = $3,600.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get 4x = $2,400.\n\nDividing both sides by 4, we get x = $600.\n\nSo, the cost of the 28 inch TV would be $600 + $200 = $800, and the cost of the 30 inch TV would be $600 + $400 = $1,000.\n\nTherefore, if Alan had bought only the 28 inch and 30 inch TVs, he would have spent $800 + $1,000 = $1,800.
