The hotel buys 2x newspapers on Sunday and x newspapers on Monday, so it buys a total of 2x + x = 3x newspapers in a week. \n\nThe cost of buying newspapers on Sunday is $4 per newspaper, so the hotel spends 4(2x) = 8x dollars on Sunday newspapers. The cost of buying newspapers on the rest of the days is $1 per newspaper, so the hotel spends 1(x) = x dollars on the rest of the days. \n\nThe total cost of buying newspapers in a week is $210, so we have the equation 8x + x = 210. Combining like terms, we get 9x = 210. Dividing both sides by 9, we get x = 23.33. \n\nSince the hotel cannot buy a fraction of a newspaper, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the hotel buys 23 newspapers on Monday. The answer is (A).", "Let's assume that the number of friends who initially planned to go on the picnic is x. Each person was supposed to contribute Rs. 96/x. But since 4 people did not turn up, the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each.

This means he received 115% of the votes that the other candidate received.\n\nLet's say the other candidate received x votes. Then, the winning candidate received 115% of x votes, which is 1.15x votes.\n\nThe total number of votes is the sum of the votes received by both candidates, which is x + 1.15x = 2.15x.\n\nSince the winning candidate received 115% of the votes, we can set up the equation 1.15x = 4000.\n\nSolving for x, we get x = 4000 / 1.15 = 3478.26.\n\nTherefore, the winning candidate received 1.15x = 1.15 * 3478.26 = 3997.99 votes.\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, the winning candidate received 3998 votes.\n\nThe answer is (E) 3998.", "Let's assume the number of copper coins she brought is x.

The cost of papering the walls is Rs.260, which is equal to the cost of 10x^2 * 2 = 20x^2 meters of paper. \n\nThe area of the doors and windows is given as 15 sq.m. The width of the paper is 50cm = 0.5m. So, the length of paper used for doors and windows is 15 / 0.5 = 30m. \n\nTherefore, the total length of paper used is 20x^2 + 30m. The cost of the paper is Rs.2 per meter, so the total cost is 2(20x^2 + 30) = 40x^2 + 60. \n\nSince the total cost is Rs.260, we have the equation 40x^2 + 60 = 260.

In this case, the perimeter is 340 meters, so 2(length + width) = 340. Since we are given that the boundary is 1 meter wide, we can subtract 2 meters from the length and width to get the dimensions of the inner rectangle. Let the length of the inner rectangle be L and the width be W. Then, 2(L + W) = 340 - 2 = 338. Dividing both sides by 2, we get L + W = 169. \n\nThe cost of gardening the boundary is equal to the area of the boundary multiplied by the cost per square meter. The area of the boundary is equal to the perimeter multiplied by the width of the boundary, which is 1 meter.

So the volume of aluminum in the coin is \u03c0(7.5)^2(2) = 225\u03c0 mm^3. \n\nSince the volume of the coin is twice the volume of aluminum, the volume of the coin is 2(225\u03c0) = 450\u03c0 mm^3. \n\nFor the new coin made of pure aluminum, the radius is 30/2 = 15 mm and the height is 1 mm. So the volume of the new coin is \u03c0(15)^2(1) = 225\u03c0 mm^3. \n\nSince the volume of the new coin is equal to the volume of aluminum in the original coin, the weight of the new coin is equal to the weight of aluminum in the original coin. \n\nSince silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of the new coin is half the weight of the original coin. \n\nThe weight of the original coin is 30 grams, so the weight of the new coin is 30/2 = 15 grams. \n\nThe answer is not listed in the answer choices.", "Let the number be x. \nAccording to the given information, (2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x. \nSimplifying this equation, we get (2/3)x - (1/3)x = 50. \nCombining like terms, we get (1/3)x = 50. \nMultiplying both sides by 3, we get x = 150. \nThe answer is (C).", "For a quadratic equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) must be greater than 0.

So, she will take 100 km / 10 km/hr = 10 hours to cover 100 km. However, she also stops for 10 minutes at the end of every 15 km. So, she will have to make 100 km / 15 km = 6.67 stops. Since she cannot make a fraction of a stop, she will have to make 7 stops. Each stop takes 10 minutes, so the total time for stops is 7 stops * 10 minutes/stop = 70 minutes. 70 minutes is equal to 70/60 = 1.17 hours. Therefore, the total time she will take to cover 100 km is 10 hours + 1.17 hours = 11.17 hours.
